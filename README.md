Electric Vehicle Trends and Sustainability Metrics (2017-Present) â€¢
I'm excited to share that I've successtully completed my data-driven research project as part of my B.Tech at Lovely Professional University. This project focused on analyzing the NYSERDA Drive Clean Rebate Program to understand trends in electric vehicle (EV) adoption, environmental impact, and consumer behavior from 2017 to the present.
Using Python, Pandas, and Seaborn, I explored a rich dataset of over 300,000 entries, performing exploratory data analysis, correlation studies, and insightful visualizations to identify the most popular EV models, rebate distribution patterns, and the environmental benefits of different vehicle types.
This project not only sharpened my skills in data analytics and visualization, but also deepened my understanding of how public policy and sustainability initiatives intersect with technology and consumer choices.
Looking forward to contributing more toward green technology and data-driven innovation in the future!
